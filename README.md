         - South Africa :
         
    * Variant of High Consequence
        - no variants of high consequence have been identified
        
    * Anitbody treatments :
       - specific monoclonal antibody treatments may be less effective for treating cases of COVID-19 caused by variants with the L452R or E484K substitution in the spike protein
